    "BFS is a better choice for this problem because if one of the first few moves taken by DFS is wrong, meaning that the move must be reversed in order to reach a path to the goal state, then DFS has go through all reachable states following the wrong move before it can get back to a state from which the goal can be reached because the visited list condition prevents move reversals.  Traversing all children nodes in this manner will take a significant amount of time since there are a very large number of feasible states in the 8 puzzle (9!/2).  BFS has the benefit of exploring all paths of a given length from the start state before moving to a deeper level of the search tree.  This means it will explore all good and bad paths, and will terminate as soon as it finds the path of shortest length (fewest number of moves).  The drawback for BFS verses DFS is if the solution involves a large number of moves, which means running BFS will require a significant amount of memory to complete.  The time to run BFS also increases as the minimum number of moves to the solution increases."
